		<h2>Why cycling</h2>
		<p>Cycling can help to protect you from serious diseases such as stroke, heart attack, some cancers, depression, diabetes, obesity and arthritis.
			<br>Riding a bike is healthy, fun and a low-impact form of exercise for all ages.
			Cycling is easy to fit into your daily routine by riding to the shops, park, school or work.<br>
		Although daily exercise like cycling will improve your cardiovascular health, lift your mood, and boost your fitness, you can easily
			pedal an hour a day and not lose a pound. ... With the right adjustments to your riding (and fueling) routine, you 
			can pedal off unwanted weight</p>
		<p>The number of calories you burn in either exercise depends on the intensity and length of time you do it.
			In general, running burns more calories than cycling because it uses more muscles. However, cycling is 
			gentler on the body, and you may be able to do it longer or faster than you can run</p>
